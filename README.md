# Movie Recommender System - Content-Based Filtering Overview

This project is a **Content-Based Movie Recommender System** that suggests similar movies based on their descriptions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Features

- **Movie Recommendations**: Suggests similar movies based on content.
- **Content-Based Filtering** using metadata (title, genres, overview).
- **Feature Engineering**: Stopword removal, vectorization (TF-IDF, Bag of Words).
- **Cosine Similarity** for measuring movie similarity.
- **Streamlit Web App** for easy user interaction.

## Dataset

**Source**: TMDB Movie Dataset

**Key Features**:
- **Title**: Movie name.
- **Overview**: Short description.
- **Genres**: Movie categories (Action, Drama, Comedy, etc.).
- **Keywords & Cast**: Important for similarity calculation.

## Data Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values**: Dropped incomplete rows.
- **Text Preprocessing**:
  - Lowercasing
  - Removing punctuation & stopwords
  - Tokenization

## Vectorization Techniques

- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)**
- **Bag of Words (BoW)**

## Recommendation Algorithm

1. **Input**: User enters a movie (e.g., Avengers).
2. **Feature Extraction**: Converts text into vectors using TF-IDF.
3. **Cosine Similarity**: Measures similarity between movies.
4. **Movie Suggestions**: Returns top similar movies.

**Example**:  
For *Avengers*, recommendations may include:
- Iron Man
- Thor
- Guardians of the Galaxy
- Captain America

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK
- **Vectorization**: TF-IDF, CountVectorizer, Cosine Similarity
- **Deployment**: Streamlit

## Challenges & Future Improvements

Cold Start Problem: Address new user/movie challenges.

Performance Optimization: Improve computational efficiency.

Deep Learning Models: Consider Word2Vec or BERT for better recommendations.

User Feedback: Implement rating-based filtering for better accuracy.

Business Impact & Applications.

Streaming Services (e.g., Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube): Increase user engagement, retention, and revenue.
E-commerce: Product recommendations based on user preferences.

Finance: Personalized investment recommendations.
